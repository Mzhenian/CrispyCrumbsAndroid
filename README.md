## Running the Crispy Crumbs App

The app is built for Android versions 10 to 14 and is designed to run on Android devices and emulators.

### 'Personal Android Device'
There are two crispy-golden ways to run the app on a compatible Android device:

1. **Install the APK**: Download the APK from the [releases section](https://github.com/Mzhenian/CrispyCrumbsAndroid/releases/tag/v1) and run the app.
2. **Android Studio**: Download the entire project and open it in Android Studio. Connect your device via USB or Wi-Fi and enable ADB debugging in the developer options. Then, select the "app" run/debug configuration and click run.

### 'Emulator'
1. Download the [entire project](https://github.com/Mzhenian/CrispyCrumbsAndroid.git) and open it in Android Studio.
2. Add a virtual device using the device manager in Android Studio and run the app on the emulator.

At any point, you can navigate through the app using the side menu, which adjusts based on the user's login status to show only relevant options.

## Work Process

Our project was a collaborative effort. We initially met to plan and divided tasks using Jira. We designed mockups with Figma and then began coding the app. The journey was both educational and enjoyable.
