## Work process -  
Our project was built collaboratively as a team. 
Initially, we planned the work together using Jira and divided the tasks among us. 

We created mockups for the website and application pages using Figma, and then we started working on the code for both the application and the website. The process was educational, and we thoroughly enjoyed the journey.
